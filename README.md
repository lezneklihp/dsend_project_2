## Repository content:<a name="Repository_content"></a>
This repository includes .py files for the second project of the Udacity Data Scientist for Enterprise Nanodegree.

## Software requirements:<a name="Software_requirements"></a>
Python version 3.x & the followings packages:
- numpy==1.18.1
- pandas==1.0.1
- sklearn==0.22
- SQLAlchemy==1.3.13

You can then run the .py files "process_data.py" & "train_classifier.py" in your terminal with the following commands (for example):

  python process_data.py ./data/disaster_messages.csv ./data/disaster_categories.csv DisasterResponse.db
  
  python train_classifier.py

## Motivation:<a name="Motivation"></a>
Twitter allows its users to share concerns with the public. In the case of an emergency, making others aware of a problem can potentially save lifes. When time is short, however, it could turn out to be challenging to interpret many Twitter messages quickly.

The idea behind this project is thus to analyze and to categorize Twitter messages. Thereby rescuers can understand faster how to help people in need. This idea has been originally suggested by Figure Eight Inc.

## Summary of results:<a name="Summary_of_results"></a>
work in progress

## Acknowledgements & licensing:<a name="Acknowledgements"></a>
- Thanks to FigureEight for their data on Twitter messages.
